Some people, especially Windows users, are used to running graphical applications. Here it is! We bring you the brand new desktop client for `loophole`!

I'm happy to announce that we recently released the very first version of our `Loophole Desktop` client.
The Desktop Client brings all the features available in the CLI in more user-friendly form.

To get it, simply go to [download](/download) page and choose the correct link for your operating system in section called `Desktop`.
