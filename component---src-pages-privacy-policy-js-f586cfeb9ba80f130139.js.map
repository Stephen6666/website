Each data subject has the right granted by the\n          European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as\n          to whether or not personal information concerning him or her is being\n          processed. If a data subject wishes to exercise this right of\n          confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact our Data Protection\n          Officer or another employee of the controller. Right of Access. Each\n          data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator\n          to obtain from the controller free information about his or her\n          personal information stored at any time and a copy of this\n          information. Furthermore, the European directives and regulations\n          grant the data subject access to the following information: the\n          purposes of the processing; the categories of personal information\n          concerned; the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the\n          personal information have been or will be disclosed, in particular\n          recipients in third countries or international organizations; where\n          possible, the envisaged period for which the personal information will\n          be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that\n          period; the existence of the right to request from the controller\n          rectification or erasure of personal information, or restriction of\n          processing of personal information concerning the data subject, or to\n          object to such processing; the existence of the right to lodge a\n          complaint with a supervisory authority; where the personal information\n          are not collected from the data subject, any available information as\n          to their source; the existence of automated decision-making, including\n          profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at\n          least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved,\n          as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such\n          processing for the data subject. Moreover, the data subject has the\n          right to obtain information as to whether personal information is\n          transferred to a third country or to an international organization.\n          Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be\n          informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer. If a\n          data subject wishes to exercise this right of access, he or she may at\n          any time contact our Data Protection Officer or another employee of\n          the controller. Right to Rectify. Each data subject has the right\n          granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller\n          without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal\n          information concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of\n          the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have\n          incomplete personal information completed, including by means of\n          providing a supplementary statement. If a data subject wishes to\n          exercise this right to rectification, they may, at any time, contact\n          our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller.\n          Right to Erasure. Each data subject has the right granted by the\n          European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of\n          personal information concerning him or her without undue delay, and\n          the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal information\n          without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as\n          long as the processing is not necessary: The personal information are\n          no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were\n          collected or otherwise processed. The data subject withdraws consent\n          to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article\n          6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where\n          there is no other legal ground for the processing. The data subject\n          objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and\n          there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing or the\n          data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of\n          the GDPR. Personal information has been unlawfully processed. The\n          personal information must be erased for compliance with a legal\n          obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is\n          subject. The personal information has been collected in relation to\n          the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1)\n          of the GDPR. If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data\n          subject wishes to request the erasure of personal information stored\n          by the Controller, he or she may at any time contact our Data\n          Protection Officer or another employee of the controller. The Data\n          Protection Officer of Controller or another employee shall promptly\n          ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately. Right of\n          restriction of the processing. Each data subject shall have the right\n          granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller\n          restriction of processing where one of the following applies: The\n          accuracy of the personal information is contested by the data subject,\n          for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the\n          personal information. The processing is unlawful and the data subject\n          opposes the erasure of the personal information and requests\n          restriction of their use instead. The controller no longer needs the\n          personal information for the purposes of the processing, but they are\n          required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or\n          defense of legal claims. The data subject has objected to processing\n          pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether\n          the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data\n          subject. Right to Portability. Each data subject shall have the right\n          granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal\n          information concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller,\n          in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she\n          shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller\n          without hindrance from the controller to which the personal\n          information has been provided, as long as the processing is based on\n          consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a)\n          of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of\n          Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by\n          automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the\n          performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the\n          exercise of official authority vested in the controller. Furthermore,\n          in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article\n          20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have\n          personal information transmitted directly from one controller to\n          another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not\n          adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. In order to assert\n          the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time\n          contact the Data Protection Officer designated by Company or another\n          employee. Right to Object. Each data subject shall have the right\n          granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to\n          his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of\n          personal information concerning him or her, which is based on point\n          (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling\n          based on these provisions. This data controller shall no longer\n          process the personal information in the event of the objection unless\n          we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing\n          which override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data\n          subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal\n          claims. The right to withdraw data protection consent. Each data\n          subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to\n          withdraw his or her consent to the processing of his or her personal\n          information at any time. If the data subject wishes to exercise the\n          right to withdraw consent, he or she may at any time directly contact\n          our Data Protection Officer or another employee of the controller.\n          Provision of personal information as a statutory or contractual\n          requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract;\n          Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal information;\n          possible consequences of failure to provide such data We clarify that\n          the provision of personal information is partly required by law (e.g.\n          tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g.\n          information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary\n          to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal\n          information, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data\n          subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with some personal\n          information when our company signs a contract with him or her. The\n          non-provision of the personal information would have the consequence\n          that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before\n          personal information is provided by the data subject, in this\n          circumstance the data subject must contact our Data Protection\n          Officer. Our Data Protection Officer clarifies to the data subject\n          whether the provision of the personal information is required by law\n          or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract,\n          whether there is an obligation to provide the personal information and\n          the consequences of non-provision of the personal information.\n        </FeatureText>\n      </FeatureItem>\n      <FeatureItem>\n        <FeatureTitle>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</FeatureTitle>\n        <FeatureText>\n          BY USING THIS WEBSITE AND/OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU AS THE DATA\n          SUBJECT CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
