Loophole assigns random hexadecimal names to the HTTP tunnels it opens for you. This is okay for one-time personal uses. But if you're displaying the URL at a hackathon or integrating with a third-party webhook, it can be frustrating if the tunnel name changes or is difficult to read. You can specify a custom subdomain for your tunnel URL with the --hostname flag
